### What I learned

This WebApp was mostly a refresher on concepts I had learned earlier. I have been busy with school and other things which ultimately left me feeling a little rusty with Web Development in general. Overall, I feel quite happy with my solution to this challenge and I think it came out great.


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  all: unset; /* cool way to remove default styling/
}
```
### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This site helped me create good looking css. I'd recommend it to anyone who feels like they could improve in css. It has many great tips and I refrence this site a ton whenever I create new projects.
- [FlexboxGuide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand flexbox. I hadnt used flexbox in a while so I was a little rusty but this article really helped me refresh my memory.
- [Removing default css](https://css-tricks.com/overriding-default-button-styles/) - A great article about removing default css.
